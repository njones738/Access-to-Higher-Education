# Personal data projects

Use this template repo for your personal data projects. Would you please use the following format for your repository? Please name your repository in your personal space using the following naming structure `[title]-[lastname]-[languagesused]`.  You will then complete a pull request to move your personal data projects into our organization.

- __Project Purpose:__ Take one to two paragraphs to explain your goals.  Why did you use this data? What skills are you going to demonstrate? Did you do this work for a client? 
- __Tools used:__ Provide an overview of the programming languages and packages you leveraged for this work.  You could provide links to the pertinent reading material that you leveraged to complete the job. Provide links to your final scripts stored in your repository.
- __Results:__ This is your conclusion.  Explain why your work matters.  How could others use it?  What are your next steps? Show some key findings.

## Writing about data science

[Thusan's article on how writing about data science is not easy](https://towardsdatascience.com/lets-admit-it-writing-about-data-science-is-not-easy-37a376777d36) could be helpful as you document your project and skills.

## Data sources

You don't need to make these projects complicated. These projects are built to show your work using the skills you have developed during the course. I would make sure that these are presentable in your Github space. You want to demonstrate your creativity. You could use the following links to find a new data set. 

- [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)
- [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)
- [WorkoutWednesday](http://www.workout-wednesday.com/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [data.world](https://data.world/search?context=community&entryTypeLabel=dataset&q=free+data&type=all)

## Github pages

It would help if you took the time to publish your repo for easier viewing of the files.  Please follow the directions at [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) to build your pages footprint on the internet.

## Questions

### Is the expectation of our personal projects similar to that of the class projects we are completing?

Yes & No. Here are a few points to highlight the comparison

1. Three different data sets is the main criteria. Hopefully different challenges to your skills and the data can be in the same area for all three if you desire.
2. You can choose the language. Please choose based on where you want employment.
3. We don't get much into the story telling with our class projects.  But, I would hope you tell a story that includes some graphs and analysis.
4. Think of these as sales pitches for future employment. Your personal projects should be in your own Github space.
